I always take my toll - blood, or gold.
I'll fight for a cause. I won't die for one.
Kings come and go, but gold stays.
Everyone has a price.
Wealth is my kind of burden.
I make my own fortune.
Loyalty isn't earned. It's bought.
You can't tame the desert.
Laws are whatever works at the time.
Heroes go hungry.
It's not stealing if they're dead.
The only thing I look up to is the sky.
Honor is the rust on a dull blade.
You've got a problem, I've got a price.
Get paid, and get out.
I've got values - they stack up nicely.
This one's on me.
You die for free.
Life's cheap. Death pays.
I go where the trouble is.
It's just business.
Don't get between me and my gold.
Step light, strike hard.
Here's where I get my cut.
Easy pay.
Crack 'em like a tomb.
Victory is what I'm paid for.
Another fight, another fee.
You're worth my time - dead.
Make me work for it.
Feed the jackals.
Catch!
Take this!
Better duck!
Heads up!
Back off.
Nice try.
Cut purse? No. Cut throat? Yes.
They say the desert is a cruel mistress. I like the sound of that.
You can't take it with you, so give it to me.
Look up. See the buzzards circling.
Alright Azir, let's put your ascension to work.
Looks like trouble runs in the family, eh Azir?
You always were a snake. Now you look the part.
Your inner beauty really shines through, Cassiopeia.
Oh, look. I'm about to step on a snake.
That forked tongue could use a matching forked face.
You'll make a nice bag.
I could use a pair of croc skin boots.
Keeping the Ascended in line is a full-time job.
Ascension is a problem. I'm the solution.
This is my desert.
Hmm... I could get used to this.
Yeah. I am that good.
I do my own dirty work.
They asked for Ascension. Give it to them.
Take back what's ours.
Send more goons. I think it's working.
Takes a lot to stay at the top.
Business is good.
Another contract completed.
Come to my desert, pay my price.
