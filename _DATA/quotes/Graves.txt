Dead man walkin'.
Go ahead! I like moving targets.
This is gonna tickle.
They picked the wrong fight.
Think I'm bluffin'?
Like fish in a barrel.
End of the line.
I've got no time for games.
What are you playin' at?
Feelin' lucky?
Try me.
Easy, partner.
Got any bright ideas?
Always trouble.
Let's settle the score.
I ain't got time to bleed.
Don't die, yet! Heh, that was only a warning shot.
Hope you weren't planning to die of natural causes.
I like my enemies two ways: dead, or about to be.
Everyone's a hero... till you shoot off a leg or two.
Lights out.
Lights out!
All in.
Bettin' blind.
Bettin' blind!
Night night.
Night night!
Who's in the dark now?
I've got your darkness.
Aah...  tarnation...
