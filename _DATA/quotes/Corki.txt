I'm up to snuff, and gots me an ace machine!
Delta Sierra at 12 o'clock!
Incomin'!
It's a Charlie Foxtrot!
I've got a bogey on my tail!
Bombs away!
Consider yourself spanked, nugget!
I'm on it, blackshoe!
Speed of heat!
Another fine sortie!
Now, I'm all spooled up!
Ready to fly!
Zoooom...!
This is Major Tom to ground control!
That just goes to show you you're nothin' but a Whiskey Delta!
Lima Oscar Lima!
