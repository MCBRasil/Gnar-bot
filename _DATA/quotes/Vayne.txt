Let us hunt those who have fallen to darkness.
I bring swift death.
I release them from their pain.
I pass judgment.
They will be purified.
Cleansing blood with silver.
Beware!
On wings of night.
I hear the innocent cry out.
I smell black magics.
The shadows are to be feared.
In the dark all is laid bare.
Evil lurks around every corner.
The dark should fear me.
Hitting me is like boxing with shadows.
I have no time for nonsense.
Joke? What do you mean?
Silver of the moon.
The purifying element.
Purge with silver.
Time for reckoning.
The die is cast...
Impure fools.
