What doesn't kill you just isn't finished yet.
They'll have more holes than my favorite cheese.
Mine!
I demand tribute!
I demand a sandwich!
Shooting's easy. Aiming's hard.
Plenty more where that came from! Seriously, I carry a lot of ammo.
Boop!
I dealt it! It was me!
Look what the pipes washed in.
How do you aim with all this light?
Stand still! My eyes are on the side of my head!
I greased these all myself.
Exterminate this!
Ripe for the picking.
No touching!
Hope that gets infected.
What's yours is mine.
Ohoho, that's gonna fester.
I licked this bolt for you.
It'll only hurt 'til you die.
Aim, then shoot. Aim, then shoot.
Are you gonna finish that?
Aged like a fine egg.
I can't even taste the air up here.
It's sticky so you don't drop it.
Hey, what did I step in?
Have you met my fleas?
Hop on, lice.
Don't trust any liquid you can see through.
All pipes lead to home.
Rust is like more delicious mold.
What's 'sharing'?
They are the plague.
From out of the sewers comes... doom.
Who let all these plants survive?
Dip it in sewage... leave it in the sun for a while... oh, yes, that's perfect, yes!
Ohoho, yes, yes.
They're planning something, I know it.
I'm on to you!
Watch your step.
Who's following me?
Always pack a snack a month in advance!
Ah, finally ripe!
Sneaking around really works up your appetite!
I'm a connoisseur of the finer things!
One of these is going to get stuck in your head.
They can play this at your funeral.
I'm dedicating this piece to you.
I hear you're trash! Bow before your king!
The only thing the sun's good for is what it does to milk.
Stop moving my stench!
Oohoohoo, Singed! You smell nice!
I have this uncontrollable urge to follow you.
I see why everyone chases you.
You remind me of home.
I thought this place could use a little gooping up.
I'll be right under their noses.
Time to go.
Sneaky, sneaky...
It's me! Hahahahaa!
Hi!
Oh, hello! Huhahahahaa!
I was hiding! Hehehahaa, grr!
You're welcome!
I'm gonna want that back!
Here's something that won't wash off!
Now, there's a smell you can feel!
You're looking a little green!
Share this!
Sewer skewers for everybody!
Pins and needles!
Bleurgh, this tastes awful!
Must... take... food!
D'ohh, it's not even stale yet!
Ow! That almost caught my tail!
Now I have to gnaw my leg off... oh, no, I'm good.
This is entrapment!
Oh, not again!
This will do.
It's mine. I</b> licked it.
Ah, a little stench and it'll be perfect.
Oh, this doesn't smell at all.
Shiny? Ugh.
Shiny, not for long.
My ears are tingling. My... tail is tingling.
Needs more... sludge.
You drink this?
Ooh, this'll put hair on your tail.
My last whisper will be street bacon.
My last whisper will be maggot pie.
My last whisper will be curdle pops.
My last whisper will be yogurt mold.
Nobody sneaks into my turf.
I need these for my stash.
Trespassers will be shot, then looted, then... chewed on for a while.
I'm watching.
Keep out.
Trespassers will be gnawed.
Oh! What do you want?
Taste of my disease.
Ohh... yes, yes!
I strike from the shadows.
This will do...
I'll be right there!
Do you smell that?
You smell terrible!
Oh, what's that smell? Oh, it's me...
