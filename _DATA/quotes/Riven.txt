What is broken can be reforged!
So much death.
A necessary strike.
It must come to pass.
They've crossed the line.
For those who were lost.
Violence to end violence.
To serve the greater good.
I am awakened.
There is no other way.
They cannot go unpunished!
The time for talk is over.
Sacrifices must be made.
So long I've wandered...
How should I proceed?
My spirit is not lost.
Burdens of the past.
What conflict awaits?
Choose your own path.
My hands are stained.
Learn from your mistakes.
A sword mirrors its owner.
I know my purpose.
A moment of clarity.
Leave doubt behind.
No more hesitation.
No looking back.
A broken blade is more than enough for the likes of you!
You are beyond redemption!
I knew I should have sprung for the blade warranty.
This is why I spend so much time sheath shopping.
