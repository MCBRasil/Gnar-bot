The cycle of life and death continues. We will live, they will die.
There, for grace, I go.
It is neverending.
Their death, awaits.
Do not try my patience.
Between life and death lies immortality.
Perhaps Shurima was meant to fall.
Some things must remain buried.
Eons... pass like days.
The sky was naught but dying stars.
For centuries, I have watched.
Burdens sleep best in their tombs.
No dawn comes without darkness.
I walk through the ages.
Shurima is not of this time.
Errant words may fell empires.
The past is a tapestry of what lies ahead.
Anthropomancy: divination by entrails.
I bring death.
Soon, there will be nothing.
Life is part of a cycle. Yours is over.
Your soul will be measured.
Death is a harsh mistress.
Your spirit is hollow.
Journey into the beyond.
Return to the dust.
We approach a time of reckoning.
This too must end.
Some spirits are fated to burn.
Eternity is beyond your reach.
Who let the dogs out? Woof. Woof. Woof.
No, I will not fetch the ball.
My bite is worse than my bark.
Your legacy shall drift away; blown into eternity, like the sands of the desert.
There is such potential in one mortal life; you have wasted yours.
Rage burned away all that was good in you, my brother.
Renekton was lost, long ago. You are but his pale shadow.
Wither.
Become dust.
Waste away.
Perish.
I will show you the meaning of butchery, brother.
You have wasted your power, Renekton. Now bleed for it.
The butcher, carved to pieces.
The butcher, drowned in his own blood.
Each fork in your path leads to fire.
They toil to live in a fool's paradise.
Mortality is guilt. All will be judged.
Redemption is a hollow wish.
I am the final arbiter.
So eager to find meaning in nothingness.
I walk behind none.
Do storms pity the drowned?
Fate is a manifestation of my will.
Mortals are not meant to rule.
Hope is the opiate of the frail.
Mankind's corruption spreads no further.
Try not the temper of the Ascended.
Sink into darkness.
Such hollow, empty minds.
Only the guilty flee.
This is the way your world ends.
Grace becomes fire.
Join the lost.
Ambition is a mirage.
Here falls the shadow of despair.
A fate, sealed in blood.
Cleave through body, and mind.
Filth of the earth.
Who's a good boy? I'm a good boy.
Now that I've Ascended, I can have treats, any time.
Once you Ascend, the old clothes won't fit any more.
Martyrs are just the first to die.
I will bury you alive.
More souls for the pyre.
Power... forged in soulfire!
Fodder for my wrath.
Fuel my inferno.
Every death feeds my fury.
Doomed and devoured.
I am</b> death.
Writhe.
Shrivel.
Squirm.
Despair.
Flee.
By fire, be purged!
Run, cowards!
Scurry!
