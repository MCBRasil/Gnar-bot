Justice takes wing.
Just like hunting thresher geese.
You get the next one, Val.
Still heart, steady aim.
Fly swiftly... kill swiftly.
Strike from the sky.
Flush 'em out.
Look Val, snacks.
Stay on the target.
I'll follow your lead, Valor.
Find me a path.
A bird's eye view is the best advantage.
We're in this together.
Demacia is counting on us.
We've got this covered.
Stay alert.
Buy me some time.
Val's stealing all the glory again.
There's always a trail.
Sometimes I swear that bird is just showing off.
I live behind enemy lines.
Stick to the plan, Val.
We Demacians are no easy prey.
Demacia needs heroes.
Who's there? Jarvan who? Uh, Valor!
Who's there? Fiora who? Valor, that's just mean!
Who's there? Garen who? Yeah, I guess he does say that a lot.
I'd keep my head down if I were you.
I've got friends in high places.
Valor's shadow is the last thing you'll see.
Go for the eyes!
Gouge 'em, Valor!
What do you see up there?
Need eyes on 'em!
Eyes in the sky.
Now!
Valor, to me!
