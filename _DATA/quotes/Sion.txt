Rest is for the living.
It's been too long.
Battle... yes!
When does the killing start?
Killing, I know.
Another corpse for the pile.
Ally, enemy... I don't care.
They'll never find all your pieces.
More enemies!
My axe is getting cold!
I will kill you all!
I will break you!
I must be sated!
Give me an enemy.
I taste blood in the air.
I'll use their bones to pick my teeth.
I will ruin you.
Raise your weapon!
Your life is mine!
I'll pull you apart!
I'll rip your head from your spine!
Your cries disgust me!
Bleed for me!
I'll grind you to dust!
I'll drown you in your own blood!
I'll rip the meat from your bones!
Blood will spill!
I'll drink from your skull!
Drink their blood!
Run from me!
I'll whet my axe on your bones!
The hunger, it grows!
You all die too quickly!
Stack the bodies higher!
I'll make a mountain of the dead!
I... do not bleed.
What am I?
No... pain... no... feeling... but hunger... 
Why do I feel... nothing?
What toll have I paid?
These wounds bring no pain.
This hunger... it gnaws.
The quiet... eats at me.
Where are they?
How many battles have I won?
I hate this waiting.
Where is the thrill of carnage?
I need a slaughter!
Always marching.
Forget the faces of the slain.
Slay the strong, trample the weak!
Blood is the wine of victory.
Cowardice will be met with death.
Noxus suffers no cowards.
Death had its chance.
Only cowards fear death.
Victory is soaked in blood.
Break their will and their bones.
Winning is like breathing.
Our drums will drown out their screams.
Blood!
War!
Kill!
Bleed!
Die!
Maim!
Tear!
Crush!
I had a funny bone, then I crushed it. Laugh, worm!
The mewling of your orphan children amuses me! How's that for funny?
It's murdering time!
Your puny body is the only joke here.
Your... puny body is the only joke here.
You look just like your ancestor: dead!
How many Jarvans must I kill?
Four Jarvans, and you're all still failures! That is funny.
Why don't I have coverage for prosthetics?
So, uh, Urgot. We can't hang out any more. I'm cool now.
You reek of fear!
Come out and die!
Your bones will pave my road to glory!
More grist for the mill of war!
Your snapping bones are music to my ears!
I don't care what your name is!
I know you... I want to remember killing you!
Time to cut your strings, puppet!
One of us will finally die today!
We've clashed a thousand times... no more!
I killed you once... I'll kill you again!
I'll plant that banner in your corpse!
Next in line, next to die.
Today, we'll see if ghosts can bleed.
Even death trembles before me.
You will be privileged to die... under my boot!
You are not my general!
I am not your pawn, Swain!
You are weak, Swain! You are no leader!
Shattered earth and bodies!
Broken stone, broken bones!
Quake and die!
Die and be silent!
Feel that?
Crumble!
You are worms!
A black eye for the earth!
Even the ground trembles!
Leave no stone unbroken!
You're nothing!
My blood burns.
Heat... and... rage!
Fire in my veins!
I feel no pain!
Is that all?
Think you can take me?
You can't even scratch me!
I hear the screams!
The din of the dying!
Out of my way!
Worms!
Scatter!
You can't hide behind lackeys!
Pathetic!
You're mine!
Get up! Fight!
Is this what passes for war?!
Chaaaaaaaarge!
Noxus!
I'll crush you all!
Dieeeeee!
Nothing will stop me!
Vermin!
I! Am! War!
Cowards!
The spoils of war.
I will drench it in their blood.
I'll bury it in their skulls.
If it breaks, so will you.
I'll break it in.
Hand it over before I kill you.
Another trinket to be shattered.
It will do.
No mere spell will stop me.
A sword lacks heft.
This cleaver... will be red soon.
This is not the first dead king's weapon I've taken.
It longs to kill.
Yes... I like this weapon.
These will wade through the blood of thousands.
Nothing will keep me from battle.
Every step will crack the earth.
Good enough to stomp insects.
This will stop their flailing!
Do you feel a shiver down your spine?
Ah... cold fear.
I'll shatter the gates of Demacia with this hammer!
Cold as the grip of death!
I'll feel their bodies grow cold.
This will sever a thousand heads.
Spells... hmph.
Protection from the bites of gnats.
A dark omen for my enemies!
They will break first.
All will burn in my wake.
They'll beg as they burn.
Fire... good... 
Leave no wound unanswered.
This was made for war, as am I!
This is the only fortress I need!
This has seen many battles.
Battle scarred... I like it.
Show me the enemy.
Let them sneak, then let them die.
A trap for vermin.
This battle is done.
They can cower a little longer.
I'll be back.
I'll be back.
The enemy awaits.
There's death to deal.
This is the ground you'll die on!
Running is futile!
Where are you going? Nowhere!
I... feel... alive!
Blood... on my... hands! This I remember!
I do not tire! I do not bleed!
More! More!
Losing... myself... 
Not yet... I can hang on... 
My... mind... will not dim!
Slipping... 
I must live again... 
I crave more!
Watch in vain as machine conquers man.
I am the prototype and the pinnacle - the first generation and the last.
I ask for so little - just undying devotion.
Function over form. Destruction above all else.
I am not programmed for mercy!
Brace for impact!
You are defective!
Steel always wins!
Your blood will oil my engine!
You are a cog in a machine!
Your heroism will be your undoing!
Next stop: oblivion!
End of the line - for you!
I'll show you malfu-u-unction!
Crush, kill, destroy!
Time to... let off some steam!
With unmatched precision!
Peace... in my</b> time!
Take the pain train!
Commence termination.
Lethal force authorized.
It is you</b> who are flawed!
I will make good use of your surviving components.
Sacrificing your lives for your better is noble.
Yes!
You are merely fuel!
Who's the unstable prototype no-o-ow?
I am pure, by design.
Robot means slave - I am robot to no-one!
People only call prototypes unstable when they're scared.
Function is greater than form.
I have a one-track mind.
Machines do not bleed.
I have surpassed all my makers' hopes - and fears.
There is no need for further iteration.
I will crush all those who think they are my better.
I am no-one's slave.
I am fully functional.
Why develop further when the prototype achieves perfection?
All are obsolete but me.
Do not cross me.
I will crush humanity beneath my wheels!
I will tear the metal from Runeterra and throw the rest away.
They say I am just a prototype - I say they got it right the first time!
They tried to decommission me - so I decommissioned them first!
Imagine this planet, clad in silicon and steel.
I am Hell - on wheels!
Death is the right of all sentient beings.
I shall grind their bones to dust beneath my wheels.
There is no fight in progress.
I am more than the sum of these crude parts.
Picture a perfect world... where all follow me!
They call it 'compassion'. I call it weakness!
One machine can do the killing of fifty men!
I was born of fear and weaned on hate.
With every conflict, I grow stronger.
Compassion lies outside of my mission parameters.
I derive no pleasure from this.
I do not tire. I do not bleed.
Hope... is a human delusion.
Recognizing one's innate superiority can hardly be called going rogue.
Empathy is a break on the wheel of progress.
I will laugh at you now.
You are on the wrong side of the tracks.
Pray for a quick death.
All I see are useless bells and whistles.
My model lacks fear.
D-disappointing.
You suffer from planned obsolescence.
Pathetic!
Insolent upstart.
The mistake was leaving you with feeble organic components.
I shall assimilate your so-called power and make it my own.
Your flesh will prove your downfall.
Flesh may rot, but I will reign forever.
Consciousness is wasted in your feeble body.
Your species did accomplish one thing of note - it made me.
Fear... is a human weakness.
Flesh... so frail.
Your obliteration shall lay the tracks for a more efficient future.
You will wish you were wrought of iron.
I was designed to supplant you.
My gears will grind your bones.
I'm less a cow-catcher than a cow-punch!
Off the rails, you hobo!
You are a technological dead-end, Blitzcrank, while I am the first of the greatest of my kind!
Dunk this.
Hope you aren't here for a fair fight.
I don't require an engineer.
There's no Illaoi... without 'owie'!
Lights out, Jax.
And people call me a trainwreck-k-k.
There are no other models; I am unique!
Mine's bigger than yours.
Heroes are overrated.
I represent the future, you throwback!
The only evolution... is revolution!</b>
The pinnacle of your 'Glorious Evolution' stands before you, Viktor. Are you not pleased?
All aboooooard the hype train!
Always close your mouth before you accelerate.
Change shapers mecha incognito.
I'm not falling apart! I just need a little duct tape, that's all.
I played train once - my passengers did not survive when I decided to walk.
Error... rerouting auxiliary power!
Flesh is weak - metal endures!
I cannot be stopped!
Manual override!
Default programming activated!
Finesse is for the weak!</b>
Feel my steel!</b>
On track for pain!</b>
You are less than nothing!</b>
Unstoppable!
Who needs brakes?
Maximum velocity!
Forward!
Choo choo!
Roll out - and over!
Ramming speed!
Greetings - I would like to purchase items with human currency.
That's the ticket.
Patching. Installing.
Downloading schematics.
How can you improve on something... that is flawless?</b>
Time to gear up-p-p.
Yes, I have a license for this Trinity Force software!
I require no further upgrades - but I just love these boots.
Assimilating additional armor.
Nice name.
Let them blunt their weapons on my steel.
None are more righteous or more glorious than me.
Even an engine of destruction can use a boost.
They can hide... but they cannot run!
This train is bound... for glory.
Pray my gaze never falls upon you.
None shall escape.
I will find you.
Being the dominant lifeform is so depleting... I need to recharge.
I'll be ba- un- atn-! Sorry... I'll be back.
This is not a retreat - only a switchback!
Backtracking to the station.
Argh! Right in the caboose...
