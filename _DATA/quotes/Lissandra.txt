I will bury the world in ice.
I am Iceborn.
Flesh freezes so easily.
Foolish child.
Succumb! It's inevitable.
The cold will numb your pain.
Your time has passed.
You can't stop an avalanche.
Embrace the cold.
Feel the power of true ice!
Your death serves greater purpose.
Another frozen corpse.
All will kneel... in time.
I see things clearly.
I will restore Freljord's greatness.
Plans within plans.
There will be no thaw.
Battles come and go. I am eternal.
The Watchers will return.
This world has forgotten true power.
So many secrets buried in ice.
No one will remember them.
They cannot fight the cold.
This is but a battle. I've already won the war.
I never rest.
I've been killing your kind for centuries!
Surrender. My triumph is inevitable.
The world began in ice and it will end in ice.
Close your eyes and let the cold take you.
I've killed so many queens I've lost count!
Kneel before me and I will unleash your power!
You really</b> picked the wrong side.
I make cold look... hot.
I consider frigid a compliment.
Is it cold in here, or is it just me?
Freeze!
Entomb!
Kneel!
I am Iceborn.
Flesh freezes so easily.
Foolish child.

At last, our ascension is at hand!
The Iceborn rule Freljord!
