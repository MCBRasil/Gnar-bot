By my will, this shall be finished.
I love a challenge.
Purge the unjust.
Topple their forces!
Righteous retribution!
Ours is but to do and die.
Protect the faithful.
For my father, the king.
No quarter for the wicked.
Find me greater foes.
Who dares defy my will?
Stand with me, brothers and sisters.
Demacia: Now and forever.
Today is a good day to die!
We shall rest when we are dead!
Could I be more epic?
Fetch the rest of your team... I'll wait.
You like my weapon? Come on over for a closer inspection!
Demacia! Get some!
Sunder any army, crumble any mountain, leap the great--- owwawww... oh, my toesies.
Awareness is the key to victory! Be sure you never let your guard dow--- awwowawwoah.
Demacia!
DEMACIA!
For the King!
I must... not... fail.
