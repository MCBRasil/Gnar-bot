Our rage is beyond your control!
Their fear is wise.
Weapons are for the weak.
Feral instinct guides our fist.
We will make use of their pelts.
Their death will only feed our rage.
Without hesitation.
Do not deny your instincts, summoner.
That is our path.
We will not pity the defenseless.
Our instincts are razor sharp.
Our rage is beyond your control!
We do not know pity, even for you!
If PETA asks, this fur is fake.
Hear me, spirits, and rise to my call.
The energy of creation is our strength.
From the four corners ancient guardians wake.
Guide my strength.
Send their spirits to the wild.
Prey upon fools.
Fury of the tiger.
With claw and fang.
Put them on their heels.
Hold nothing back.
Indestructible!
Push through their defenses.
Give no ground.
We do not yield.
Pain is of the mind.
Strength of the bear!
Overwhelming force.
Run them down.
Raw power.
Flames of the phoenix.
From ashes.
Cleansing fire.
Burn away the meek.
Descend upon them.
Life speaks through us.
Our spirits have merged.
Our journey continues.
Wrath of nature.
Stalk the enemy.
We hear the rustling of prey.
Ready to pounce.
Our blood runs hot.
Slow and steady.
Maintain guard.
Defend all sides.
Unbreakable will.
Strength of mind and body.
Who would stand against us?
Power without bounds.
Crush any barrier.
Charge forward.
We are filled with might.
One's spirit must fly free.
Wind and fire.
Heart of flame.
Rite of the ancients.
Gaze upon us in awe.
Stripes would</b> be good camouflage... if tigers weren't bright orange!
The turtle is one part fortress, one part mobile home.
Man, I love honey, but bees... ugh!
Emanating fire really cuts down on comfy nest options.
You'd make a good scratching post.
My shell has this little dent in the shape of your face.
You'd look better after a good mauling.
All I see are soon-to-be ashes.
Fury of the tiger.
Tough as the turtle!
Strength of the bear!
Flames of the phoenix.
Spirits, rise!
United as one!
Supreme focus!
Perfect harmony.
This place is at peace.
Return to nature.
No spirits linger here.
A necessary sacrifice.
We have slain the dragon!
The dragon is no more.
We have crushed the spider.
This spider will spin no more webs.
We've destroyed the baron. His spirit is free.
The Baron's reign is ended.
A cougar is no match for a tiger.
Put those claws away, Nidalee.
Nidalee relies too heavily on one form.
Whose shell will crack first?
An impressive guard.
Not OK, Rammus.
Teach this northern bear a lesson.
A bear should not need armor.
The Ursine will know fear.
Thaw the Cryophoenix.
Fight ice with fire.
We shall clip Anivia's wings.
Keep watch.
Vigilant eyes.
The spirits observe.
We must rejuvenate our will.
A brief meditation.
To replenish body and spirit.
The hearth fire calls.
We endure.
The spirits return.
We are whole again.
We are needed.
We breathe once more.
Rejoin me spirits.
The battle calls.
