Punch first. Ask questions while punching.
A little smash and grab.
Here comes the punchline!
Come on! Resist arrest already!
One girl wrecking crew.
Freeze! Or don't, I don't care.
Put a dent in 'em!
Vi, hah, stands for violence!
Vi stands for vicious.
Vi stands for vice.
Here I come to save the day... or wreck it.
They'll never know what hit 'em.
Let's get crackin'.
I'm doing this my</b> way.
Piltover's finest.
Plan? I don't need a plan.
Let's get to the fun part!
Who needs a beat-down?
If you hit a wall, hit it hard!
Sometimes you gotta make</b> a door.
I let my hands do the talking.
I'm my own backup.
I've got five reasons for you to shut up.
If I want your opinion, I'll beat it out of you.
I like you as far as I can throw you... not even.
Care for a spot of tea? Or maybe a spot of punch in the face</b>.
Oh, look at me... I'm on the case.
We can either do this the hard way, or... Oh wait, no. There's just the hard way.
Hmm, I like your smile. Gives me something to aim at.
I like your smile. Makes a nice target.
Why can't I get a straight answer? It's always just 'Oh no! Stop hitting me! Ow, my face!'
Welcome to the party. Try the punch</b>.
Nice shot, cupcake.
Aww, was that supposed to hurt, Cait?
Nope!
Yeah! Teamwork!
High five, cupcake!
Boom! Headshot.
Get dunked!
Eat this!
Boom, baby!
Hey Jayce! Power slam!
