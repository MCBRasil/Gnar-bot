There is no antidote for me.
Who will have the fortune of facing me today?
So many strings waiting to be pulled.
Another game of snake and mice.
Come, look me in the eyes.
Do not turn your back on me.
Just a taste.
Such unrefined creatures.
Die with grace.
Am I getting under your skin?
I can predict your every move.
Let me in.
Destroy them from the inside out.
Poison takes so many forms.
One touch is all it takes.
Running only accelerates the venom.
Soon it will all sink in.
Don't be coy.
You won't forget my embrace.
Good to the last drop.
My affection runs deep.
You won't feel a thing.
Careful, now. I bite.
Violence is so messy.
Patience, darling.
I'm not so easy to get out of your system.
Spineless? No. Flexible? Extremely.
Keep your enemies close - and me closer.
Like what you see?
Power requires precision.
Think what I could offer.
Do not tempt a viper.
Do you have a longing? Would you like one?
Secrets are sharper than blades.
If you don't control pawns, you are one.
I'll take care of everything.
Watch your step.
Every problem is an opportunity.
I know what everyone wants.
Many wars begin with a whisper.
I like to leave a lasting impression.
Wealth is valuable only as a means to power.
If you wanna' be on top, you have to reach for it.
No legs but I still have a little spring in my step.
Nothing escapes my coil.
Eventually they all come crawling back.
It's just not possible to sink to the level of this competition.
Sometimes failure just creeps right up on you, doesn't it?
Azir, I intend to prove a powerful ally.
Our interests align, Azir. Let us pursue them together.
Our interests align, Azir. Let us pursue them together.
Oh, Sivir, all you ever needed was a sharp prodding.
Apologies, Sivir, I dispose of tools that have exhausted their use.
Sivir! Back to die so soon?
I do love getting up close and personal.
We all wear masks. Some better than others.
Let's enjoy our company just a little bit longer.
Keep your eyes open.
Watch and wait.
Trust what you see.
I may leave, but I'm never gone.
I'll be back soon. Miss me.
My attentions are needed elsewhere.
The simple seek to achieve Ascension. The wise prepare to exploit it.
A Noxian always rises to the top.
Yes! Now who shall have my attention?
It seems I must handle things personally.
The power is yours, now! Use it!
Turn their Ascension against them!
This is Ascension in the hands of a Noxian!
Failure is an elegant poison. Let it seep in.
To the clever go the spoils.
Our every move led only to this moment!
