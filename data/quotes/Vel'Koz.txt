Knowledge through... disintegration.
Bones are surprisingly inflexible.
Tears appear to serve no function.
You may experience mild... incineration.
Ah, another entity of value.
Intriguing reaction to pain.
Thank you for your... contribution.
Are no organs safely removable?
I acknowledge your pain.
Their skins appear non-transferable.
Hm, this is a fragile species.
Creature appears to seek its maternal unit.

I must know more.
Let's see what they're made of.
I require a closer look.
I find their elbows obscene.

High concentration of subjects... wonderful.
Endoskeletal... quite peculiar.

Creature's mewling increases during dissection.
Human melting point remains... inconsistent.
Genders are more easily discerned by the pitch of their cries.
To date, none have survived preliminary testing.
A land rich with information.
The pattern is clear.
Ah, the Void. I miss the darkness.
Replicating lifeform entertainment routine!
Research requires good tentacle-eye coordination.
It seems your chances of survival are... less than zero.
Let's see... yes, infinity</b> more samples required!
