The Black Rose shall bloom once more.
Time to make an appearance.
There's no escape.
Watch closely.
What a treat.
Right where I want them.
Surprised to see me?
Where next?
It's all smoke and mirrors.
Patience, summoner.
Tricky, aren't you?
Are you certain?
Trust me.
Classic misdirection.
Looks can be deceiving.
Would I lie?
For a moment I thought I'd broken a sweat.
For my next trick I'll make their life bar disappear.
Lying is, like, ninety five percent of what I do.
