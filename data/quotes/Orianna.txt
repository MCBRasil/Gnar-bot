We will kill your enemies. That will be fun.
I have sharp things.
We are as one.

So strange, they scream.
Why do they keep breaking?
Winding.
I hear soft things.
Motivating.
We go.
This is very exciting.
This is a fun game.
The ball is impatient.
Time tick-ticks away.
Why are they running?
I know what makes them tick. I know how to make the ticking stop.
They come apart so easily. How do you put them back together again?
When you fall, you get right back up.
Ravage.

Pulse.
