Agony, ecstasy, peace. Every passing has a beauty all its own.
So many souls await.
We all have a place among the divine. We have only to accept it.
My pilgrimage begins.
Join the chorus of death.
Expire.
Revel in the undoing.
Your time has come.
Release your mortal coil.
Rest in peace.
Sleep now, child.
Darkness envelops you.
Hear my song.
The rhythm of your life slows.
I sing the word of death.
It is written.
I crave the parting.
Ah, the kiss of death.
Die by my hand, and rise anew.
Sleep without dreams.
Silence, groundwalker.
Die for metal.
Join me in this duet of demise.
It's time... to wake the dead.
Lights out - forever.
In the end, only the dead shall remain.
We are forever.
Hear the elegy of the lost.
I can give you certainty.
You all die, why not choose how?
Have you ever felt a calling?
You are only the cocoon.
Solace comes with a still heart.
Soon, all will wane.
The Shadow Isles sing louder than any siren.
What trickery is life?
Truth is what I offer.
Death is but a horizon.
Death is a song all will hear.
Follow my voice, and slip away.
You have been dying from your first breath.
The faithful never fear the grave.
Never hunger, never tire, never fear.
May death free us all.
You will forget breath, you will forget love.
Shed no tears for the dead.
You are the candle burning unto nothing.
You are a doomed vessel.
Pain is the herald of your salvation.
<span style=
Amp it up.
Tower diver! Gotta' get away, get away!
We totally topped the charts in the Freljord!
Death is blacker than the blackest black... times infinity.
I'm putting your name in my little black necronomicon.
Do you have a moment to talk about death?.
What's the incantation again... yes, erm... oh, right, R!
Listen, mortals, as I speak the word of... my cookbook.
Dear diary, met a wonderful ghoul today...
Sorry, I'm booked through... er, brrrr... forever.
Urgot, hm, I highly recommend death at this point.
When the going gets tough, the tough get a Deathcap!
What have I done? Created beauty by simply rocking! That's all.
What is that sound? It's the pounding of creation's hammer on the anvil of time!
I will shred your body, and burn your soul!
Your death will be excruciating!
Life clings like a parasite to a soul!
The song of your life will be brief.
To feel the caress of death for the first time... I envy you!
You deceive your followers. I will enlighten them.
Death's horse needs no bridle.
You are but the herald, Hecarim. Remember who you truly serve.
Your light is but a candle in the infinite dark.
Lucian! Join her!
Abandon your mortality, and find your precious Senna.
You can always join her, Lucian. It will be bliss!
You give the dead purpose, Mordekaiser. I give them meaning.
A shell of flesh or a shell of metal? Both ring hollow.
Sion, we must free your soul from the prison of flesh.
You are only the echo of greatness, but I can give you a voice again!
Death has more meaning than torment alone, warden.
You may shackle the living, but the dead must walk free.
Abomination, you have cheated death too long.
You are on the eve of liberation, Varus.
Waaao!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Whoa!
I am become death!
Gaze upon me and despair!
Behold your undoing!
The shell means nothing!
You can't kill the metal!
The sustain! Listen to it!
This is eleven</b>!
Time for my encore!
Waahaahaahaahaaao!
Cross over.
You cannot escape.
Feel the frailty of life!
Your bodies betray you!
To flee is to suffer.
You will not die alone.
Sing, my children.
Behold my chorus.
Feel the spirits.
Rise and sing!
Countless voices in unison!
Listen and rejoice in death!
A dirge for those who remain!
Hear me, mortals!
Sing with your final breath!
Die!
Surrender!
Perish!
Cease to be!
I am the lightbringer!
Everyone will falter when you die!
My son, smite them all!
I watch.
Death sees all.
Dead eyes never blink.
A tear of loss, a tear of joy.
Angels too are the messengers of death.
Host of angels, or murder of crows?
Its power grows with time... as does mine.
A companion for all time.
A crown for the king of death.
Its old master served my patron well.
Ah, the song grows.
I hear the echo of a Rabadon; it is exquisite.
None can outrun death.
When death's grip finds you, it clings tightly.
This crystal will sing with me.
No-one can hide from the end.
It will turn their mantles to shrouds.
What can protect you from the inevitable?
The grave has all the time in the world.
The sands slip away like lives.
Freeze that moment, on the threshold of oblivion.
Come, drink of the grail.
Death prevails.
I go where death bids me.
When I return, more shall join my choir.
What kind of man embraces death?
No good will come from your sorcery, Karthus.
I also hear the songs of the dead.
A man who chose to join us... glorious.
Unleash us, Karthus!
I serve you willingly, Lich!
The dark requiem will be the last thing they hear!
