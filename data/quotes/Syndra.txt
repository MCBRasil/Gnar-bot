So much untapped power!
I am in control.
By force of will.
Let them try to stop me.
My potential is limitless!
A whole world to toy with.
More! I can be so much more!
People fear what they cannot understand.
This power is mine</b> to command.
Easily.
Imprisoned no longer.
Jealous fools.
I will not be restrained.
This is what I live for.
Run, playthings.
They are nothing to me.
Such power!
And they said I lacked balance. Ha!
See? Absolute control.
Immense power is fun! You should try it sometime.
A legion couldn't stop me. What chance do you have?
Barriers exist to be broken.
Power without limit.
I love to watch them fly.
I will not hold back.
They won't even come close.
I am untouchable.
My potential is limitless!
I will not be restrained.
