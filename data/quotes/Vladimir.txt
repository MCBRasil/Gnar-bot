The rivers will run red.
I'd love a pint.
Hmm, something is leaking.
Deliciously vain.
I'm a universal recipient.
Care to make a donation?
A draining exercise.
Wonderful.
My cup is half empty.
The clot thickens.
Please, let it all out.
Let's pool our efforts.
I'm absolutely livid.
Trickling progress.
A vital decision.
A harvest moon, so aptly named.
You look like someone who's got a lot going on beneath the surface.
Go ahead, be negative. You'll be just my type.
Feel the life drip away.
Arise and face me.
I want to make this last.
The night shall consume them.
Witness the depths of despair.
Slake my thirst.
Pitiful creatures.
Kneel before me!
The skies will rain red.
In darkness I am truly alive.
No one commands me.
I am lord and master.
There is a monster in all of us.
This is my realm.
So much blood waiting for purpose.
Which vessel shall I empty next?
I shall leave this place in ruin.
Kneel before Vlad.
Gather together your allies so you can pool your tears.
How long must I search to find a real challenge?
Ri... you--- (coughing) Ugh, bloodball.
Bask in... (coughing) What did you eat?
