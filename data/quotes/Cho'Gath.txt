Who will be eaten first?
Your souls will feed the Void!
There will be no end to your suffering!
You shall not escape!

The daylight! It burns!
For the darkness!
Summoner, your darkness beckons.
Afraid of the dark? Wise!

You cheeky little fellow!
One can survive everything nowadays, except death!
I challenge you to a duel!
I like a man who grins when he fights!
I'll bite your legs off!
Cake or Death?
Anyone for a spot of tea?
Let us fight like gentlemen!
Oh, bother!
Pip-pip! Cheerio!
Anything less would be uncivilized.
What, what... What?!
Would you like some cheese with your whine?
It's funny, isn't it? How your best friend can just blow up like that?
Ah-Ha!
Ah-Haa!
Ah-Haaa!
Up you go!
Quiet!
Quuuuiet!
Nom nom nom nom nom nom nom...
Nom nom nom nom nom nom nom...
Oh no.
