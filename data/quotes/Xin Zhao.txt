To the arena!
Fate has made its choice.
Do not bore me.
Press the assault!
Perish with honor.
Their lives are forfeit.
Here's a tip, and a spear behind it!
My king commands.
It shall be done!
To triumph!
The warrior's spirit is never broken.
A Demacian does not retreat.
Victory calls.
Always forward.
Sound the march!
Only actions truly speak.
I may be outnumbered, but not even the odds can stand against me!
Find me an immovable object, and I'll put this question to rest!
