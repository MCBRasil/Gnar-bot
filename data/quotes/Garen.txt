My heart and sword always for Demacia.
Victory awaits!
Accursed villains.
Battle the infamy.
I will lead the charge.
Vile scourge.
The scoundrels will pay!
I will fight as long as I stand!
Justice, by law, or by sword.
What we do is right</b>!
We are the vanguard.
Show them the strength of Demacia!
Forge onward!
For Demacia.
In the King's name.
I bring justice.
Fear not, I'm coming.
To protect our land.
I stand ready.
This world needs hope.
Never forget why we fight!
Demacia marches as one.
We fight for those who cannot.
Our deeds shape the future.
Fear is the first of many foes.
Keep faith in yourself.
Be bold; be just!
Our courage must never waver.
Come forth, you will find honor in death.
The glory of Demacia will never fade.
No matter your numbers, I will not yield.
Darius, you are a butcher, not a general.
Extend the hand of Noxus, pull back a stump.
I've got a lot of weight on my shoulders!
Hey, look, I'm holding the world up!
I could do this for hours. Really.
Darius, eat your heart out.
Seven thousand and two--- oh, I didn't see you standing there.
Demacia... 
Charge!
Forward!
Stay resolute!
Demacia!
Hold fast!
Break their ranks!
I will not falter!
Justice!
For the cause!
Demacia!
Demacia...
