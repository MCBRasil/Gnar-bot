I'm no hero - just a Yordle with a hammer.
The hammer isn't mine, just keeping it until the real guy shows up.
I've heard a lot about this hero with a hammer, can't wait to meet him.
Hmm... if I were a hero, where would I hide...?
Not coming back 'til I find that hero.
One time I thought I found the hero... but he died.
Today's the day I find that hero.
I can do this.
Here goes everything.
I hope this works.
No backing down.
Swinging from the heels!
Sorry about this.
Careful, this packs a wallop.
You should probably take cover.
Ready, hammer?
One whomp at a time.
You might wanna' look out.
Keep swinging til' you hit something.
Better get your guard up.
You're in my way.
Guess we're fighting.
You are... definitely not the hero.
Whoa! You're a big fella!
This should really be the hero's job.
Wow. That's a lot to hammer.
Sorry, your majesty.
This guy seems nice. I feel bad about killing him.
I really don't have anything against dragons.
Nothing personal, but... I need to squash you.
What do you mean my hammer's too big?
If you're waiting for me to give up, you might be here a while.
Me? The hero? Nah, that's ridiculous.
I sure do a lot of walking.
Yep, it's even heavier than it looks.
Oh, you like to fight? So does my hammer!
Guess I'm going this way now.
Do not</b> make my hammer mad.
Every step is one step closer.
Some things are too important to give up on.
Who knew there were so many heroes?
I gotta' see this through.
The hammer does most of the work, I just swing it.
How Demacian of you!
I'm in one-hundred-percent! That's everything, right?
Okay, I admit it. I'm lost.
I hope the hero likes me.
Sometimes you just gotta' do it yourself.
Just had a thought - three pigtails!
Man, quests are hard.
Know what I could use? A cart.
I could really go for a nap.
Seems you left your brave pants at home. Want me to wait while you go get them?
This hammer has two sides. Did you want to feel the other one too?
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, uh... hammer!
Could you maybe get out of the way? Y'know, so I don't have to flatten you.
You know, gargoyles and Yordles have a lot in common.
Oh, wow, Garen, do you think you could sign my shield?
Garen, I think you might be the one!
A pleasure to fight for you, your majesty.
That's not a hammer! This</b> is a hammer.
Look at all that shiny armor. Sorry I gotta mess it up.
I'm about to hammer you in the jewels.
I don't get Yordles. Too fluffy.
Jokes? Yeah, I know jokes.
A Demacian, a Noxian and a Freljordian walk into a tavern.
The barkeep asks, 'What'll it be?'
The Demacian says, 'Uh, I'll have a wine.' No, wait, an ale! Yeah...
Then the Noxian says, 'I'll have a... a wine.' Yeah, he wants a wine.
And the Freljordian says, 'I'll drink anything, so long as-' Wait, hold on, let me start over.
A Noxian, a Targonian and a Piltie are robbing a bank.
The bank guy says, 'I'll give you whatever you want.'
The Noxian says, 'I'll take whatever gold you got back there.'
The Targonian says, 'Gimme' all your gemstones!'
And the Piltie says, 'Can I own this ba- uh, I own this bank, so...' He doesn't want anything because he owns</b> the bank...
Shield to the face!
Left hand!
Clang!
Hope it's not dented.
Got it.
Shieldy.
Hammer!
Comin' down!
Not so fast!
What's the hurry?
Nope.
No getting through me.
Hold up!
Uh uh.
Back off!
Look out!
Outta' my way!
Move it!
Hold it right there!
You. Sit.
Freeze!
Don't move!
Look at him go!
Remember to roll!
Up goes the guy!
And don't come back!
And stay there!
Huh. Didn't know I could do that.
Whoa. You went far.
Whomp!
Wait, you're here? I thought you were there.
Didn't I just knock you away?
Goes great with a hammer.
Yeah, just like the hero would buy.
Yay, more stuff!
Got me some hammer accessories.
One shield for throwing, and one for holding.
A hammer for my hammer.
I'll just add it to my other hammer.
Well, two hammers are better than one.
Hmm... nice weapon. Does it come in hammer?
You smash people with it, right?
It's a little big, but I'll grow into it.
Alright, sneakies... I know you're out there.
Just in case they come creeping.
Wait, what did I come back for?
Now, back to finding that hero.
Anyone seen a hero around here?
To the hero!
Fuel for the quest.
Hold on...
Keep fighting...
Not like this!
Not today!
Right in the hammer...
One thing about me: I'm not good at staying down.
That's okay. I'm playing the long game.
Let's try that again.
Valoran will know harmony.
Fighting is serious business.
I'll settle this issue!
Their defeat is non-negotiable!
Let me demonstrate Hammer Diplomacy!
They'll beg for peace.
If it is necessary.
If it will bring peace.
Valoran will know harmony.
We are in accord, Summoner.
My convictions will not falter!
Immediately!
Agreed!
Why don't you just lay down your weapons now?
Jokes? I don't know any jokes.
