Live and die by the blade.
This is no challenge.
Pathetic!
Their bones will whet my blade.
Another body for the gutter.
This blade's my favorite.
Enjoy the taste of steel.
Let's finish this quickly.
There's nowhere to hide.
Don't cross me.
On the razor's edge.
Your allegiances mean nothing to me.
I never compromise.
Only fools pledge life to honor.
They won't survive.
Eventually, my blades will find their way into your heart.
Have you anything to offer but weakness?!
Ugh, I lost another blade. I wonder who it's in this time.
The worst part of losing a blade is trying to trace back all my stabbings.
