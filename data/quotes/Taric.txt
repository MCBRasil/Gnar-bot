That glimmer of hope you see, that's me.
There's nowhere left to go but up.
I have risen beyond the call of banners and kings.
There is great power in the stars. Great danger as well.
The most precious jewel is the one we hold in our heart.
The climb may be long, but the view is worth it.
Crash the mountain upon them.
The heavens guide me.
Let me make myself crystal clear.
The heavens strike swiftly.
To protect all.
I serve life, but deal death.
Beauty can stir one's heart... or stop it.
Gems always hold their edge.
Beauty and life.
I will shatter them.
The stars care not.
Memories are my worst enemies.
This crystal will never crack.
Wither in my radiance.
These gems aren't just for show.
I climbed Mount Targon. You did not.
Targon weeps for you.
I find all life beautiful... except yours.
This world's fragile beauty must be preserved.
The stars keep the darkness at bay.
The mountain endures.
Don't worry, I am here.
You seem to have too many heads. Let's see if I can help you with that.
I know I'm supposed to cherish all life, but come on.
The taint of the Void is upon you.
Nothing personal, but you've got to go.
Let's see how hot things get.
Greedy beast.
I may be merciful, but Targon isn't.
The best weapons are beautiful.
Sometimes, life is worth dying for.
The stars were the question. I was the answer.
The mountain's mysteries are known to me.
Why is it always the ugly ones?
Easy on the eyes? Don't I know it.
The Protector speaks through me.
I am no longer the man I once was.
We're all headed toward the same inevitable end. No need to rush.
Demacia was my home, but the stars are my destination.
I have seen the light too clearly to ever fear the darkness.
The mountain reveals the harshest truths in our souls.
Human life is fleeting, a mountain's life less so, but stars... stars are eternal.
The stars freed me from myself.
My heart is filled with starlight. I give it freely to all.
The mountain showed me my path.
Truth is worth fighting for, but beauty is worth dying for.
True gems sparkle even in the absence of light.
Elegance never helped win a fight, but it never hurt.
Love is simply beauty crystallized.
To truly see the stars, I climbed.
We see beauty in the stars, and they see beauty in us.
Just as the mountain is eternal, so is hope.
Each life is a rare jewel.
The mountain's question is unique for each of us.
I answered for my crimes. Now it's your turn.
Let me broaden your worldview.
I bested the mountain. Now it's your turn.
That bow is of the stars, as is its mistress.
No star should be bound.
Own your destiny, or it will own you.
Who could have guessed the Aspect of the Moon would be so beautiful?
I will never turn my back on Demacia.
Good to see you again, old friend.
I bend knee to no king.
I will purge the Void from this world.
They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
I will enjoy sending you back to the Void. In pieces.
Shine on, you crazy diamond.
The heavens see all you have done.
The sun is but a traveller through the kingdom of the stars.
Ah, the Aspect everyone hates.
You are weighed down by your petty hungers.
I like the cut of your gem.
Are you even wearing pants?
I've been to the top of the mountain... and the bottom of the gutter. There's much to learn from both.
Beauty can be deadly... and manly. Very manly.
What did I see upon the mountain? Rocks. Lots of rocks.
Much like a fine gem, I'm multifaceted.
You know what they say about big gems, right?
My gems aren't merely outrageous, they're fabulous.
It's okay if you're impressed. The Protector was too.
I'm much more than a pretty face.
Two tickets to the gem show.
Gems are truly, truly, truly outrageous.

Gems are truly, truly, truly outrageous.
We must serve life.
Bask in the glow.
A little something from Targon.
Rest easy.
Fight on.
Stand against them.
Never submit.
For beauty.
Honor the mountain.
Always forward.
Up the mountain we go.
Vigor.
Crack their resolve.
The fight never ends.
A little glimmer in their eyes.
For Targon.
Let me show you something.
Gems are wonderful distractions.
Clarity.
Blind them with our light.
Say hello to my little gems.
Gems hurt, don't they?
Embrace the cosmos.
Shake the pillars of heaven.
Money well spent.
A fine addition.
Always useful.
And one of these...
Natural gem enhancement.
A thing of beauty is a joy forever.
One can always use extra clarity.
I can see my mountain from here.
Oh, the sights we'll see...
Ruby for vigor, eh?
Can't say no to a ruby.
My kind of stone.
Work of an artisan.
A cold shoulder indeed.
Frozen beauty is still beauty.
Wish I'd had this on the mountain.
Can never be too warm... or too beautiful.
The sun's embrace is welcome.
You can always use a little extra protection.
What's a 'mog' anyway?
This will match nicely.
Something to accent my chest.
Shuriman, eh?
Fits well.
The finest craftsmanship.
I thank the mountain for its gifts.
Just like the old days.
Memories of Demacia.
Fight fire with fire.
I will hurl them back with their own weapons.
Divination indeed.
Better safe than sorry.
The sands of life.
Not true Targonian. Still nice, though.
So misguided, those Solari.
Feels right.
That's a face I'll never forget.
The mountain makes beautiful things.
Targon is always with me.
Not that I'll need this.
Good armor, bad name.
Let's test this promise.
Smooth.
An Aspect still needs help now and again.
Fade and begone.
Never a dull day.
Well, that was refreshing.
Beauty is a job well done.
In the end, we only regret the chances we didn't take.
Looks like a mountain fell on them.
Just in case.
Look sharp.
Mind your step.
An Aspect's work is never done.
Let's climb that mountain, shall we?
Challenges await.
Failure has always been my greatest mentor.
No rest for the chosen of Targon.
No, I didn't see stars.
My light never dims...
