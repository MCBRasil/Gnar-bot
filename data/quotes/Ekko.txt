Ah... that fresh start smell.
Time to start some trouble.
Someone's day's about to get wrecked.
We'll do it the hard way!
I could</b> make this hurt less.
Make me repeat myself!
Time is not on your side!
Should've walked away.
I like hitting you!
Good a time as any to act reckless.
Haha... you never see this coming.
Come on! Show me something new!
Welcome to Zaun!
I'll help you this time. Duck.
All out of warnings.
This is how we say 'hello' in Zaun.
Last chance to be anywhere else.
Keep pushing me.
Never had luck. Never needed it.
Every second matters.
Let's make them notice.
Doubt me - I love that.
No-one keeps me down.
Time doesn't heal all wounds.
Not quitting until it's right!
We make the future.
Progress doesn't belong to one city.
Tomorrow's the last of my worries.
Never look back.
Things aren't gonna' improve themselves.
Back to going forward.
I do my own stunts.
Zaun is the future.
Every rule needs a break.
Patience? What's that?
Fool me once... and I'll just rewind.
I hate being responsible.
My pasts have a way of catching up.
I'd rather make mistakes than make nothing at all.
I owe them nothing.
I finish what I start.
There are always consequences.
If there are limits... I haven't found them yet.
Uh... if anyone sees my paradox, ask 'im where I am.
The timeline was already this broken when I found it. I swear.
Let me be honest - I have no idea what I'm doing.
This is the longest second of my life.
Time scramble doesn't travel my brain.
How many Pilties does it take to make a hammer? All of 'em! Hehe...
How many Pilties does it take to make a hammer? Zero! They make 'em in Zaun!
How many Pilties does it take to make a hammer? Two, if you count Jayce's reflection! Haha! Oh, Jayce.
I already calculated your odds. Sorry.
I've seen your future - and it's got broken bones.
Won this fight already - doing it again for fun.
Run away, little Piltie!
You're in the wrong neighbourhood.
Great. Pilties.
Last warning: go home.
See? You're part of the problem!
Zaun's future's about to get brighter.
Think you're Zaun? Prove it.
Dibs on the hat!
Aw... who called the cops?
Scared of a little revolution, Caitlyn?
Go where you want, Mundo - outside of Zaun.
Garen - shouted any good names lately?
I like you better on paper, poster boy.
Nice face - shame if something happened to it.
I'll never be like this guy.
I had a crush - until you started talking to the gun.
Guns. Original.
You give Zaun a bad name.
I lost a pet rat once. Is that you, Mr Tails?
Take my time machine, Urgot. You clearly need it more.
I'll poke your eye out- head out- face off? How do you even work?
Hey, sellout!
You forgot your roots, Vi.
You used to be cool.
You'll always be Zaun to me.
One day, you'll come back to Zaun.
So, uh... how about that weather?
Never go full robot.
You're everything wrong with Zaun.
I'll never be like this guy.
Timefight!
I really hope you're not the future me.
Catch!
Heads up!
Don't blink!
Think fast!
Step right up!
Come get me!
Made it!
Surprise!
Time snap!
Go!
Look out!
Do-over!
One more time!
Reversing polarity!
Gotta' do better than that, law-dog!
Next time, shoot where I'm gonna' be!
Were you trying to hit me?
Swing and a miss, top hat!
I'm no angel.
Yep. Put an angel on the job. I could use a break.
I'm sure I won't be needing this... but I'll take it anyhow.
A second chance? I thought I was on my fifth!
I love hitting Pilties with their own toys.
Put a gun on a sword; typical Piltover brilliance.
Let's go hunt some liches?
All in - just my style.
It's like it was made for me.
How can I not buy this?
And I'm fighting with teeth.
That is one big tooth.
Not much of a hat guy... but this thing is awesome!
Rabadon must've been a fun guy.
Some things do get better with time.
Yep; this thing has a bright future.
Sometimes, age has its benefits.
Three forces at work.
Triple threat.
Can't hide your weak spots from me!
This thing creeps me out.
Huh. Freezing time. Interesting.
Stops time? Huh. Thought I'd never get a break.
I'm old enough to buy this.
You gotta' teach me that trick, Zil!
I coulda' survived that - but thanks anyway.
Yep... that went exactly how I didn't want it to go.
Back to square seven.
Let's not do that again.
Second first time for everything!
That worked in another timeline.
I need to rethink a couple things.
Back before anyone notices.
Taking a breather.
They'll wish I stayed here.

Note to self - don't touch cop's hat.
Note to self - hammer is actually a gun.
