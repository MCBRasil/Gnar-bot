This'll be a blast!
Bombs away!
Fuses burning, fuses burning!
Take cover!
Fire in the hole!
Explosion first, questions later.
It's gonna blow!
Lights out!
Right-o.
Anyone got a match?
Come on, come on, come on!
Let's blow this joint.
Hey, where'd that bomb go?
Don't worry, I got this.
What do you mean this doesn't look safe?
Impatient? I'm not impatient.
I'm going, I'm going.
I'll take this one and this one and throw it in your face!
I like my enemies like I like my bombs: about to explode.
Come on! Does this look dangerous to you?
You wanna see how to disarm a bomb?
I'll bring the Big One!
Yeee-Haaa!
Incoming!
Oh! Look out below!
Come on!
