Know that if the tables were turned, I would show you no mercy!
I will swallow your soul.
Even death trembles in my presence.
Give up now!
Even now, your loved ones suffer!
I can see the fear in your heart.
Your soul will come to serve me</b>.
I am</b> evil! Stop laughing!
I smell death.
Yes! (Laughs)
Stalking prey again?
Suffering awaits.
The magic, it calls to me!
Your commands tire me.
It's only a short way? Is that a short joke?!
You deny the darkness in your soul! You deny your power!
What's black and blue and is about to show you the definition of pain?!
Welcome to your doom!
Unimaginable is the power of Veigar!
Champions! Welcome to die!
My every victory symbolizes the crumbling of justice!
Your journey ends here, hero!
Oh, it's game over... for you!
Weakness is a disease, and I am the cure!
I can't let you do that!
Cocky little freaks!
You! Curse you!
Run, run, or you'll be well done!
I will show you true power!
You dare defy me?!
Playtime has ended!
You can't compare with my powers!
The end draws near.
Annoying champion is about to die.
You, and your friends, are dead.
Suffer, like Vee did!
Vengeance shall be mine!
Boil in mud, you meddling fool!
You are error!
I, Veigar, will knock you all down!
A battle you have no chance of winning!
I... shall reign... supreme!
Do you realise who you're dealing with?
The black wind howls.
This isn't even my final form!
What is a champion? A miserable pile of pixels.
I hunger.
Don't get mad, get sadistic!
Join me... or die!
All the cake is gone!
I will create a monument to nonexistence!
Hey! Listen!
The world is mine!
My patience is wearing thin!
I am all-powerful!
Somebody set up us the bomb!
I have fury!
Would you kindly?
My strength is unparalleled!
This is all going according to plan.
I hear the locals call me some kind of baron.
Mini... boss? Is that a short joke?!
Your entire life has been a mathematical error!
The feelings of terror only prove your inferiority!
Not even death can save you from me!
Get lost. You can't compare with my powers!
Weak, pathetic fools!
Yes...
Arcane launch detected!
Got a present for ya!
Quad damage!
Finish them!
It's no use!
Right where I want you!
Would you kindly stop moving?!
You fell right into my trap!
Toasty!
Super effective!
Delete!
Let's run it back!
I'll make weapons from your bones!
My power is over nine thousand!
I am invincible!
My power grows!
I am stronger!
No surprises!
Watch them!
They'll never reach me!
You haven't seen the last of me!
This isn't over!
I won't be defeated so easily!
What? Impossible...
I'll... remember... this...
I... ehh... urgh...
