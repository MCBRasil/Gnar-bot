The heart is the strongest muscle.
Good times, good friends... what could be better?
If they insist on a fight, I will oblige them.
Ah! We are about to begin the fighting!
Now, what can we learn from fighting?
Ah, new beginnings.
Let's get going.
Shall we begin?
Today will be exciting day!
Always bring Braum!
Follow me, friends!
They may have many, but you have me.
Is it the moustache? Who knows?
Why not enjoy some warm milk instead?
First we fight, then we eat.
My shield is my sword.
Take heart.
When going gets tough, you call Braum.
Think carefully, my friend.
Let's show our friends the door.
You hit like baby ram! No horns yet!
Now I give more than harsh talking to!
Sometimes, shield becomes smashing board.
Troublemaker toss is best game.
Now this is fun!
Show me your best.
Keep your spirits high.
Put away your worried face!
Sometimes battle is unavoidable.
Today we fight each other. Tomorrow, we may fight together.
Sometimes icy heart just needs warm smile.
Braum is on the job.
Let us go.
Move like the herd.
You are safe with Braum.
Even heaviest door can be opened.
If you have problem, you come to me first.
Mother always said - don't lose!
The darker the night, the brighter the stars.
No time for worrying.
Hehe, life is good, no?
I wonder what's around next corner.
You can always trust Braum.
If at first you do not succeed, please, tell me what it is like.
Don't worry, Braum was trying little bit.
You remind me of Agatha. Best cow back home.
Alistar! I have cow you should meet.
Mother gave me bear as child too, Annie.
Something fishy</b> here? Hehehehehe!
After this, we share a drink! You like goat's milk?
What's your poison, Gragas? Mine's milk!
Your hair... we do not see things like this in the Freljord.
Tryndamere! This is fun, right?
Are you having fun, my friend?
When life gives you curdled milk, be patient. You get very good cheese!
The goats are wise; eat everything, climb everything, and if something kicks you, kick it back!
Mother always said - float like iceberg, sting like thrown iceberg!
Strike like ram!
Not so fast!
You thought you were in trouble.
Braum is here!
Stand behind Braum!
It is easy, see?
My shield is here for you.
I'm having cold flashes.
Good shot! You'll get them next time.
Look! Your axes bounce right off!
Ah! A refreshing sea breeze!
Hm. It is windy today.
Eat, eat and grow strong.
Train hard, little poro, and one day you will be strong like... baby!
This has the smell of a faraway land. Perhaps I shall see it one day.
These shoes... they're too tight!
Ha ha! Perfect!
No sneaking up on Braum this time.
Sight is the key to victory. Also stone.
Fire does the body good.
Ohoohoo, nice and toasty.
I've always wanted an on-fire cloak!
Ooh! Now I need marshmallow.
To friends, I am snowfall. To enemies, I am avalanche!
My shield will protect this shield!
A shield for my shield? I like it!
Ah... returning home.
Hehe, time for a snack.
Back I go.
See? That wasn't so bad.
Braum lives another day.
Is very important to take time to rest.
