Beware the depths.
I will have vengeance.
Drag them down.
Fear the ocean's weight.
All will drown.
They will pay.
I will not rest.
The tide ebbs.
The endless march.
Forward, forward.
Left to die.
Find the guilty.
Peer into the darkness.
Echoes from the deep.
Lost and forgotten.
Do you hear them calling?
You are in the deep end now!
Sometimes I think this anchor just weighs me down.
