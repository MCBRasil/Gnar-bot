I find courage unpredictable, it's total insanity you can rely on!
Them's humans!
Naw, they're good eatin'.
What was that? Oh, I should go for the decakill? Uh, if you say so.
It's my property! All sixty gazillion acres of it!
Holy $%!#, where are we?
Guess we'll have to kill our way out!
Slow down so I can kill something!
Get off my lawn!
They's about to be dead!
This land is my land!
Damn trespassers!
Step on my land again, you're done!
How about a long axe in your guts?
You are perturbing my tranquility!
You should run! Skaarl likes his food lively!
Don't interrupt me! I'm trying to start a fight!
Damn city folk!
I'm Kled, and this here's Skaarl. Prepare to die.
This is how it's gonna work: I kill you, then I take your stuff.
Look, Skaarl! It's dinner time!
You see my welcome sign back there? No? It was your friend's skull!
You will salute when you address me!
Let's get them trespassers!
Why ain't they saluting me? They should be saluting me! Salute me now!
You get my invitation to visit? No? 'cause there ain't one!
Let's do it!
Oh, it's on!
I got your welcoming present right here!
The badgers command your death!
Only coffin's gonna' be this lizard's belly!
Let's get 'em, Skaarl!
I might have to jump off this lizard and put my boot in your watoosie!
Let's get 'em, 'fore they get us.
I'm gonna murder you to death!
I will murder your whole family!
My brain is on fire, my soul is strong, and my lizard is hungry!
You mocking me?
He looked at me funny! Get him.
You can't take what's mine!
You looking at me? 'cause I'm gonna' kill you!
You can't bushwhack a bushwhacker!
You just justified a preemptive retaliatory strike!
They came looking for a fight? Let's oblige 'em.
I am justified, and I am armed!
Howdy!
I'm through running!
Die!
I'll kill you!
Now you done it!
I'll gut you!
I'll say something witty after I kill you!
I'm gonna' cut you open and use your spine for a back scratcher, because it is itchy! Very itchy!
I can only express myself through violence!
Who sent you?
Welcome to Noxus!
This! Is! Noxus!
I hate you!
You's trying my patience!
Come back here and fight!
My axe talks for me!
You thought I was done? Kled ain't never done!
I can't be reasoned with!
It's go time!
I ain't stopping!
You see, Skaarl? I'm doing it alone!
I'll kill 'em all!
See, Skaarl? I don't need help!
Skaarl! You're missing the fun!
I'm just beginning to fight!
I'll kick the crap outta' you!
No trespassing!
Intruder!
You're a cockroach, and it's half-past stomping time!
My brain is full of weasels!
Serenity now!
I don't like sharing!
Oh, you prancing bastard!
My blood is piss and vinegar!
I'm gonna reach down your throat, and turn your lungs into mittens!
I'm gonna make you wish you were a hallucination!
You think I don't hear you laughing?
There's fixing to be two sounds: me hitting you, and---
Lord Colonel Major Centurion Kled don't run, no he don't!
I came here to... well, I don't know what I came here for, but I'm gonna' defend it!
Vicious!
Vicious!
Vicious!
Vicious!
Stab!
Stab!
Stab!
Stab!
Axe!
Axe!
Axe!
Axe!
This land was made for me - and me alone.
I hate to advocate violence and insanity, but it's worked for me.
Were you just talking, or was it the voices again?
I do not want my lands tamed. I want them unruly and free.
I'm from all over. It's next to nowhere and shut the hell up!</b>
I play with guns. I work with an axe.
Mushrooms are healthy! Once you get used to the madness and paranoia.
A man without a weapon ain't worth listening to.
Yeah, I like it out here. Freedom, communing with nature, killing hikers.
They ain't ready for us.
I keep hallucinating that you can talk.
Nah, I'm sure it'll pass.
Skaarl! This ain't no time for philosophying!
Killing a few things might loosen this up.
No more of that! You're upsetting the invisible badgers!
My land begins where I walk. It ends where the sun don't shine!
Damn cowards, making me ride over to kill 'em.
Well, maybe I am</b> looking to start a fight!
I do prefer to ride into battle.
Yeah, but... then how we gonna' invade both bases at once?
No, I'm positive, I ain't delusional!
Of course I'm paranoid! You tried to kill me yesterday!
Nah, them we kill them too! Ain't nobody on my team but you.
I came to cut off a piece of that Noxian dream... and I ain't sharing my piece!
Don't try and understand 'em, just rope, throw and brand 'em.
I grew up mean and now I'm older than murder.
Ain't nothing more beautiful than the Noxian plains... excepting a rich corpse.
All we need is open country, but we gonna' take everything they got!
I fight better when I've had my... medicine.
No! Planning and strategy? That's city-folk stuff!
Don't need a plan... long as I got this axe.
Yeah, they just confirming our suspicions, ain't they?
I don't have trouble communicating. Words is just treacherous bastards.
You ready, Skaarl? This day's gonna' require some mindblowing weirdness.
Are you ready for anything?
Of course you are!
Hey, it's Forward Admiral Major Kled! I ain't been a Mister since ever!
Shh! Them brain weasels probably listening for us.
Let's get to killing them interloping intruders!
Was the battle of Falgrim when I first took the rank of Sergeant General Colonel. Least, I think that's what rank they was. Gotta' remember to ask before</b> killing them.
Ain't nothing like having the wind on your back and blood on your face.
It's your birthday, Skaarl! Let's bake a murder cake!
Well, my foot wanted to meet your ass, and I'm about to give them a shotgun wedding!
Shh! It's time to get violent... and weird.
Oh, we find 'em, tie 'em up, then they's like a piñata full of meat.
Damnit Skaarl, d'you hide my mushroom juice again?
After we finish murdering these folks, what do you think? Tacos? Yeah, tacos.
First, we kill 'em, then we make 'em tell us where they came from.
Remember when we sacked Trevail, and that general thought we'd be willing to share the spoils? Pheh! Officers die just as easy as anybody.
There ain't no land that ain't mine. Just land I ain't got around to claiming.
Just 'cause they're our team don't mean we can trust 'em.
They're all trespassers, we're just killing them five first.
Yeah, yeah, invade Ionia you said, it'll be fine you said!
Fine, you said!
Yeah, reminds me of the siege of Rugg. Lot of men died on its high walls. It was fun.
At the gates of Qualthola, they tried using that boiling oil on us, but you can't deep-fry courage!
I know, I know.
Would you stop bitching for one minute?
I am deep-fried courage, and an apple pie of angry!
Because I know someone is trying to sneak up on us!
Yeah, they think they so clever! Brains don't win fights, brains is what splatter on you!
Well, you the only thing I trust.
Yeah, well, that's what I thought.
Shut your hole, you dumb lizard.
Well, just 'cause you're a hallucination and I don't speak lizard don't mean I can't understand you!
You do come up with the best ideas.
No, it's when I don't drink mushroom juice that I have a problem!
I am Kled! High Major Commodore of the First Legion Third Multiplication Double Admiral Artillery Vanguard Company! You will respect my authority!
We was having a nice conversation, then they showed up... uninvited!
Noxus was created to train the faithful.
What are you whining about? I already fed you half a platoon!
Don't you bite me again!
Naw, it's just like the assault on Glorf. You seen one artillery vanguard in a commando fleet action, you seen 'em all.
Noxus ends where I say it ends.
Ain't much I love. Only this big sky, and this dumb lizard.
Let's get some new property.
The sky is my roof, the open plains are my bed, and this lizard is the only company I need.
This big sky, this green land. Now how could I share this with anyone?
Woo, it's darn pretty round here. Glad it's mine.
You can't be lonely when the land is this beautiful.
This world is rough. You gotta' be tough or die.
Yes, a sane man would run, but I ain't the running kind!
No-one tells me what to do.
This here land is mine!
This is just a victory waiting to happen!
This desert sky's gonna' open up with a rain of heavenly bloodshed and glorious violence!
I am the brutal instrument of my own destiny!
Ain't nobody gonna' give you nothing. Gotta' take it yourself.
Impossible ain't a Noxian word.
I didn't become a Rear Forward Brigadier Admiral from running!
I don't need that lizard! Kled's got his own ideas.
I don't need nothing but this axe... and this gun... and this hat.
Why's all these intruders so far away?
I know that lizard ain't talking, but I still hear him. Shut up, lizard. Shut up!
Stop talking, you stupid brain badgers!
Hey, what was that? Of course I don't need Skaarl... but he helps.
What was that? Run straight into the tower?
I don't need a team to start a teamfight!
Sure! I'll kill all of them myself!
I don't need you Skaarl!
I said I wasn't not backing off, no how!
Even if I lose, I win! Just means I get to come back and kill you later!
I know you're listening, brain weasels! I ain't falling for it!
I am Sir Admiral Major Kled, and I smell a victory potpourri!
First thing you learn as a Lieutenant Sergeant Commodore: rely only on yourself.
Skaarl! Come back, buddy! Skaarl?
Damnit, Skaarl! I hate walking!
I didn't not earn the rank of Sergeant double Admiral by not running!
Folks say I got violent tendencies.
Oh, she'll see, she'll see! She'll come strolling back when I turn them interlopers into a purée.
Ain't nobody tough as Kled! I've got gravel in my guts and a fire in my head!
Don't worry, them voices ain't telling me to kill you no more...! Yeah, of course we still gonna' kill 'im.
You do realise... you're on my property?
I figure I'll help you kill 'em... before I kill you.
Usually I find conversation boring and useless. You remind me I'm right.
You feel like arguing about something? It'll make what happens later easier for you.
So... when exactly you planning on getting the hell outta' here?
Woo, no sir, I ain't gonna' kill you and feed you to my lizard! Them's just... malicious rumours!
Oh, before I forget, what, uh... rank are you, exactly?
You may be from Noxus, but you ain't Noxian.
Don't mess with Noxus, brother.
You know, I like you, brother. As much as I can like a lily-livered jungle-sniffer.
You sure you're Noxian? You look a little Ionian to me.
Watch your stepping! That's my land you're gallivanting on!
Drinking from battle? What kind of dumb crap is that?
Telling people you're a god? Hell, you're barely a paring knife.
Something caught in your throat? 'cause you sound desperate!
Say that again! I dare you.
Thems fighting words! See, Skaarl? That's why I don't like people.
Shut your mouth hole! Them badgers are listening.
I'm just a Yordle standing in front of you, asking you to shut the hell up!</b>
Of course, you realise, this means war.
So, that's what considered funny in the city, huh?
I got a joke too! It's called me kicking your teeth in!
That it? That was your joke, huh?
Was you making fun of my Skaarl?
Real funny! Knew a funny guy in the Dreckon campaign - took a javelin in the spine, couldn't walk after that. Used him as a coat rack.
Don't get weird on me!
Dang nabbit, you're gonna' get us killed!
Calm down, you damn-!
Whoa! Whoa! Don't get excited, now!
Don't get your britches all rumpled!
Calm down, girl!
Whoa, Skaarl, whoa!
Skaarl, I got this!
Don't you run off on me! Skaarl!
Easy, girl, easy!
Quit your worryin'!
No Skaarl, no! Bad Skaarl!
Hey! We ain't done!
Get back here you-!
Darn nabbit! You lily-livered flea bucket!
I knew you was a coward!
I ain't never forgiving you, you flea-bitten-!
Go home, get! I never needed you no how!
Not again!
No, no! The other way! Get back here!
The fighting's this way!
Traitor!
Yeah!
Yahoo!
Wahoo!
Now we got 'em!
If you does that one more time I'll skewer you and roast you myself!
Where you been?
Get over here, buddy!
Woo, good timing!
I knew you'd be back.
Dang nabbit, I love this lizard!
Boy am I glad to see you!
The badgers command it!
For the brain weasels!
Yeehaw! I knew you couldn't quit me, Skaarl!
Gotcha now!
How you like that leash?
Gotcha!
Oh, you ain't getting away!
You ain't running!
Just try and run!
You ain't going nowhere!
Get back here!
Thought you wanted to visit!
You think you can run?
I'm gonna learn you about pain!
Come back, I gotta' put an axe in your brain!
Aw, you ain't leaving, are you?
Oops, bear trap in your neck!
Get 'em!
Hyaah!
Woo!
Get 'em, Skaarl!
Yeehaw!
Yip yip!
Wowee!
Ha!
Whoa!
Wahah!
Woo!
Yah!
Hee hee!
Ha ha!
Chaaaaarge!
Chaaaaarge!
Let's get 'em!
Yaaaahoooo!
Yaaaahoooo!
Yeeeehaaaw!
Yeaaaaaaah!
Follow meeeee!
No prisoneeeers!
This is Noxus, son! Winner takes all!
That'll learn 'em!
Thought you could take my land, huh? How'd that work out for you?
How's that dirt taste?
Don't worry, Skaarl! We'll come back so you can eat 'em later.
Whoops! Looks like I accidentally stabbed you with my long axe - until you were dead!
You were a visitor, now you're mulch!
Skaarl, that was what we call a predictable scenario.
I told 'em what was gonna' happen if they came onto my land!
Next time you visit, bring more stuff I can take!
I might be a deranged lizard-riding bandito, but I whooped you real good!
Now, I might have overreacted to you unlawfully entering my property - but I don't think so!
Ahahahaha! I warned him! I did warn him!
It's funny, 'cause he died right on the border of my land, and more off my land!
Glad you could visit!
Don't let the door hit you on your way to hell!
They never learn.
Tried to bushwhack a bushwhacker!
That learned 'em real good.
We didn't come here to teach lessons in humanity!
Y'all made a nice stabbing bag.
Killing makes me thirsty.
Nothing like a river of blood to send a message.
Y'know, a long time ago, being crazy meant something.
Just 'cause we was kin don't mean I ain't feeding you to Skaarl!
Hey cous', glad you came to visit!
A relative's just another unwanted guest.
Afraid I had to cut your visit short.
You ain't cute now!
Aw, you are so cute... 'fore I ripped your fuzzy head off!
I could feel bad about killing you, or we could stomp on your corpse!
You was cute - lousy, but cute.
He died as dumb as he sounded.
And he ain't even had the indignity to call himself a demon.
Never had much to say, but I'm sure glad we shut him up.
Girl was all messed up.
I mean, before we killed her. Snake for legs? Crazy!
I guess it's snake dinner tonight!
Was that lady half-snake, or that snake half-human? She is... confusing. Dead, but confusing.
Hey, lizard food! What exactly was you general of?
Nice axe! Learn to use it!
Death by my</b> hand!
He wanted to unify Noxus. Guess that makes me a secessionist.
KLEEEEEED</b>... naw, it's just Kled.
Who wants some Kled?
This is where Kled shines!
Skaarl? You eatin' good tonight! That girl's got some meat on her!
And you thought I talked crazy!
I gotta' stop the mushroom juice... I swear that girl had some tentacles or something!
Bye bye, fancy pants!
Hey, fancy pants! Got your cloak dirty!
I don't know what he was. I just needed him to shut up.
I can respect crazy, but what kind of fool reloads in the middle of a fight?
A sinister blade? Heck, girl, Skaarl's got farts more sinister than you was.
I like a girl with moxie.
No, obviously she didn't have any! That's the darn point!
Humans is such easy prey.
She had one crazy getup! Them city-folk clothes is getting ridiculous.
Yeah, I'll try it on later.
Go back to Noxus Prime!
All your little city-girl dreams just got stomped.
We wrecked that thing!
Damn varmint left holes all over the yard.
Queen of what? Darn thing made Skaarl look smart!
Pure Noxian girl. Almost liked her. Almost.
Seems to have lost your bounce, girl.
All that hippy hop! Getting on my nerves!
How many times do I gotta' kill him?
I know!
Too stupid to live, too dumb to die.
I don't think you can eat that one.
He looks a little overripe.
Huh. I liked him better when he was alive.
Tactician? More like bird brain.
Master Tactician? He can keep that heading.
He gonna' taste good deep-fried.
I figure he gonna' taste like chicken.
Sure!
Well, that shut him up!
Finally, some silence.
I knew he was a liar, 'cause he used them big words.
I've seem some dumb outfits, Skaarl, but a cape made out of knives? Woo, ha! That took the cake!
Another dead city boy, thinking he could sneaky-sneak on my land.
Let that be a lesson for all them sneaky-sneaks!
I keep my eyes open - all the time.
I ain't paranoid - I'm ready. Real ready.
They's always trying to sneak up on us. Trying, that is.
I know them trespassers is somewhere...
Them sneaky-sneaks ain't gonna' sneak on us, no sir!
It's mine, and I got my eye on it!
Yeah, any of them varmints sneak up on us, we'll know.
It ain't paranoia if everyone is</b> out to get you.
Paranoia... means having all the facts.
There's no such thing as paranoia; your worst fears can come true at any moment.
Paranoia is just another word for ignorance.
Total paranoia is just total awareness!
Skaarl! Skaarl!
